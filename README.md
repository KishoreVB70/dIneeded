# CeloWork
### A decentralized approach to freelanced work.

1. Create a job listing for any contracted work you need completed, the bounty for the job listing must be paid upfront.
2. Submit proposals for job listings you are looking to complete.
3. Proposals must then be activated by the owner of the job listing. (one active proposal per job listing)
4. Once work is done on the job, the owner of the job listing will then release the bounty to the proposal owner.
